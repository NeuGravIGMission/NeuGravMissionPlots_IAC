# NeuGravMissionPlots_IAC
Plots presented and used for the IAC conference, Paris 2022

This repositary holds all of the plots that were created for the Neutrino simulations in Neptune's atmosphere. The plots presented here only focused on Cherenkov Radiation.

The top level folders are broken down into the particle types that were sent through the atmosphere, Electron, Muon, and Tauon.

Inside those folders we have each of the corresponding energies that were looped over, 10 GeV to 1 TeV.

Inside each of those energy folders we have 3 folders that contain the plots of the collected data from the simulations. We have 2D hit maps that are created to see how these Cherenkov distributions change at the various orbits but also with interaction depths. Next we have these orbit map plots that mimic what a 10 meter diameter detector would observe as it is orbiting the planet and crosses over the axis that the neutrino interactions occured. Lastly, we have these timing distributions of the collected data from the orbit map plots that look at how long the overall process lasts of these photons being created and then incident on our detector that orbits the planet.
